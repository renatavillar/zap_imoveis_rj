#zap_imoveis_rj

I collected data from https://www.zapimoveis.com.br/ about rents in Greater Rio de Janeiro, in order to build a model to predict the rent by month for a property, using its area, number of bedrooms,
bathrooms and parking spaces. Testing linear regression model and polynomial regression, I got the best model with a polynomial regression of degree 2. The Python file for the web scrapping is in the
repository, just like the Jupyter Notebook that I used to do the study.
